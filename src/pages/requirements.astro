    All participating sites must offer the course, which requires space and mechanical ventilation simulation equipment. A large lecture space with a projector and a large whiteboard is needed. Several small-group breakout spaces are also required. Additionally, budget should be allocated to host three external faculty members during the first year of the program.

    We require at least three local faculty physicians to achieve "fluent" status in the preceptorial track for the course's success. This certification starts with a two-day CME course. Afterwards, precepting physicians must complete a year-long mentored preceptorship.
