I am an assistant professor in the section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine.  I am a clinical educator and currently associate program director of the pulmonary and critical care fellowship.  My interests include severe asthma, lung function testing,  cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and mechanical ventilation.  I hope to use my experience to help enhance education in respiratory physiology as it applies to all of these topics.
