Please review this page for an overview of the process. Once you've read through the information and decide to move forward, you can email [Dr. Burton Lee](mailto:burton.w.lee@gmail.com?subject=Joining%20CCERC).

<br>

## Arrange for an Initial Meeting
Schedule a briefing with Dr. Burton Lee approximately 18 months before the intended course date. During that call Dr. Lee will outline the enrollment process and typical resource needs.

<br>

## Secure Institutional Support
Obtain approval from your division chief and fellowship program director. This is essential as the program depends on protected time for both fellows and teaching faculty.

<br>

##  Obtain IRB Approval or Exemption
Our consortium engages in educational research and we ask all sites to participate. Therefore, obtaining IRB exemption or approval is necessary before the course starts.

<br>

##  Secure Resources for the Mechanical Ventilation Course
All participating sites must offer the course, which requires space and mechanical ventilation simulation equipment. A large lecture space with a projector and a large whiteboard is needed. Several small-group breakout spaces are also required. Additionally, budget should be allocated to host three external faculty members during the first year of the program.

<br>

## Prepare and Certify Local Faculty
We require at least three local faculty physicians to achieve "fluent" status in the preceptorial track for the course's success. This certification starts with a two-and-a-half-day CME course. Afterwards, precepting physicians must complete a year-long mentored preceptorship.
