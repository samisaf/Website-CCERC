This is a year-long program designed to train preceptors and teachers in the principles and application of mechanical ventilation. The curriculum is rooted in pulmonary physiology as it relates to mechanical ventilators. Key topics include Ohmâ€™s Law, the equation of motion, pulmonary resistance and compliance, autoPEEP, ventilator asynchronies, and the work of breathing. This website serves as a tool to monitor participant progress and track learner outcomes.
